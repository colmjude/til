It's the supplement people get wrong.

Yet, it is one of the most well-researched supplements out there.

#### It has a weird rep

Creatine has a reputation problem. People think it is only for bodybuilders looking to bulk up and that it causes bloating and messes with your kidneys (a myth). The science doesn't back this up. In fact it paints a different picture.

#### What is it?

Creatine is a compound naturally found in your body, mainly in muscles and its there as a source of energy during short, intense activity.
The supplement form (go for creatine monohydrate) tops up your natural stores. Itâ€™s one of the most tested and proven supplements on the market.

#### What is it good for

According to the research it is good for:

* strength and power - the workout bit. Think a bit more energy to lift heavier, workout a little hard or run an extra bit.
* muscle growth - helps by letting you train harder
* brain function - especially under stress (who couldn't do with a bit of help in this area) and sleep deprivation
* healthy ageing - growing evidence that it helps preserve muscle mass and function as we age

#### How to use

Daily at a low (3-5g) dose.

#### What to avoid

Some people use it wrong. The general consensus is you should avoid:

* Starting with a bang. Some people load up for a few days to get going. Don't. Just start the daily habit and you'll be there in a couple of weeks without the digestive problems.
* Worrying about bloat. Thats water being drawn into your muscles. A good thing for them to be hydrated and functioning!
* Only using it on gym/exercise days. Nope, not how it works. Creatine builds up over time so consistent use is best.
* Fearing long-term use. Decades worth of studies show it to be beneficial and not a risk. The reason it has all those studies? Because it was shown to work. So people wanted to see what the catch was.
