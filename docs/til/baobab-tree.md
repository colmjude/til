### **Where do they grow?**

- **Africa**: Common in dry, savanna regions. For example, Kenyan coast
- **Madagascar**: Home to six species, including some that grow only there.
- **Australia**: One species grows in the northwest part of the country.

### **What makes it special?**

1. **Huge, swollen trunk**  
    Baobabs can look like theyâ€™re growing upside down â€” with thick trunks and branches that look like roots.  Some trunks can store **thousands of liters of water**, which helps the tree survive long droughts
2. **Incredibly long life**  
    Many baobabs live for over **1,000 years**. Some are believed to be more than 2,500 years old ðŸ˜±
3. **Useful fruit**  
    The baobab fruit is called "monkey bread" and is packed with **vitamin C, calcium, and fiber**. It's now sold in health shops around the world.  Just 100g of baobab fruit powder can have more vitamin C than oranges.
4. **Cultural significance**  
    Baobabs feature heavily in African stories and folklore. Theyâ€™re often gathering places in villages and seen as sacred.

And, they look pretty cool.
