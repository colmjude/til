Naming the main branch `master` has always felt a bit weird. Rightly, there is recognition, triggered by the BLM movement, this should change to `main`.

I think new repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com) now default to `main` but that doesn't fix all the existing repos. Luckily it is easy enough to change the name of the main branch. [Steven Mortimor has an easy to follow 5 step tutorial](https://stevenmortimer.com/5-steps-to-change-github-default-branch-from-master-to-main/).

<div class="cj-note__update">
It is now easy to do all this on GitHub. Go to <i>repo</i> -> <i>settings</i> -> <i>branches</i>, and edit the name of the default branch.
