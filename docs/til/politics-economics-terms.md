Loads of terms are bandied around and I'm often not 100% sure what they mean (are the authors?) so I decided to start logging them to see if I could make sense of them.

**Ethic of socialism**

**Liberalism**

It emphasizes the idea of freedom, and believes that the best countries are the ones that are freest. Classical liberals all believe that everyone equally deserves to be free to decide for themselves how to think, act, speak and conduct their lives with a minimum of governance or control by others including control by a formal government.

**Social liberalism**

Social liberalism is a political philosophy and variety of liberalism that endorses social justice, social services, a mixed economy, and the expansion of civil and political rights, as opposed to classical liberalism which favors limited government and an overall more laissez-faire style of governance.

It thinks the state should address economic and social issues.
