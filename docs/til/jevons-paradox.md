Jevons paradox describes how energy efficiency gains can often lead to _more_ energy usage rather than less.

Essentially, activity X becomes cheaper/easier/faster so we do more of it.

Examples could be:

* Irrigation led to more effective use of water in agriculture. The result? More land can be farmed.
* LED lights - more efficeint and cheaper than the old incandescent lights. So we stick em everywher
* Data storage - super cheap right? So what do we do? Store everything
* Faster communication - its pretty easy to communicate with people these days, there's email, whatsapp, slack, etc. So what do we do? Communicate with everyone all the time. Who doesn't have too many notifications?
* Remote work - think back to COVID times and the start of everyone working from home. How could we possibly manage? How would we be able to have the meetings we need to have? Well turns out we can have those meetings and more. The effectiveness of meetings might be reduced by having them remotely, but the effort to convene them isn't, so we have them all the time
* Processes because cheaper and more efficient, so we make more powerful ones that can do more things
* Fuel-efficient cars - reducing the amount of fuel per mile makes dribing cheaper. So we can all do it individually, whenever we need, however short the journey
* Efficient heating - like central heating. Means we can ditch the jumpers and have it on all the time

I first heard about it when reading Tim Paul's post [Automation and the Jevons paradox](https://www.timpaul.co.uk/posts/automation-and-the-jevons-paradox/)

Tim gave the following examples:

- improving road network efficiency leads to _more_ driving, not less congestion
- increasing crop yields results in _more_ crop production, not less land usage
- building a reservoir leads to _more_ water consumption, not less water scarcity
- improving data centre efficiency leads to _more_ data centres not less energy usage
