"If something cannot go on forever, it will stop"

Propounded by [Herbert Stein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Stein) when he was talking economic trends.

I saw it first reading [this @doctorow mega-thread](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1612026395428900865) about "End Stage Capitalism" and "Social Quitting". Or how eventually all platforms and companies reach an end game state. Platforms when they've extracted as much as they can from users and business customers and the enshittification has gone too far that people are motivated to leave. And companies and their exploitative and extractionary strategies reach the end - "workers can tolerate it, and tolerate it, and tolerate it - until one day, they stop" hence the [#QuietQuitting](https://twitter.com/hashtag/QuietQuitting?src=hashtag_click) and [#GreatResignation](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GreatResignation?src=hashtag_click)
