A record of some of the things I've learnt or heard about race disparities (mainly in the UK). These are either things I've not come across before or links to useful things for me to refer back to.

**Bengal famine** - Churchill routing grain away from India to add to UK's stockpiles, incase they were ever needed by UK troops during the war. They weren't, the food went uneaten, millions of Indians died.

**Bristol bus boycott** - exposing the bus company's racist hiring practises. A civil rights movement in the UK.

[Empassioned explanation of 'riots' in US](https://twitter.com/SpillerOfTea/status/1269956482839306240) - includes the monopoly example; 400 turns for the white people before you are begrudgingly allowed to enter the game. Made worse if you were part of the first 400 turns but all you earnt went straight to the other players.

[Study showing black boys are unfairly marked](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/media-library/sites/cmpo/migrated/documents/wp221.pdf) if marking is done by teachers who know they are black. So anonymity is a black boy's best friend in the education system.

[Report looking into risk of mother's dying during childbirth](https://www.npeu.ox.ac.uk/downloads/files/mbrrace-uk/reports/MBRRACE-UK%20Maternal%20Report%202018%20-%20Web%20Version.pdf)
Black women are 5x more likely to die during childbirth than white women. Why?
