Writing is a vital skill. A skill worth practising and honing.

Here is a collection of tips and resources I use to improve my writing.

[Removing all the little words](https://nicolascole77.medium.com/little-words-that-ruin-sentences-dec9f37c1a02) - demonstrates removing *one*, *of*, *the*, *that* and *is* from a sentence. The sentence ends up more readable. I would've liked the article to suggest techniques to determine which words to remove.

[Grammarly](grammarly.com) - a set of tools to help improve your writing. Includes browser extensions, an app for longer form editing and plugins for applications (Word, etc).
