A collection of clever uses of available data. Useful for selling the value of open and high quality data.

I like examples where the data is relatively simple but when used it helps someone with a boring, mundane task that they need to do.

* [Devon council using Strava cycling data](https://road.cc/content/news/devon-will-use-strava-prioritise-repairs-275345) - using data to help them prioritise which roads to fix first. Higher cycling use = higher priority.
* Singapore Gov use tree data (including tree type) with weather data to work out where there is more likely to be leaves falling. Then they can prioritise cleaning these streets.
* A solar panel installation company used freely available low flying radar images to work out which houses had south facing roofs. Then sent marketing materials to them. Better ROI?
