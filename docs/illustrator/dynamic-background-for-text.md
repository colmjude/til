Sometimes you’ll want a background for your text that adjusts to the text. And to be able to repeat it for many text items.

You can do this in the **appearance panel**.

* Add a “new fill”
* Keep fill selected. Add **Effect > Convert to Shape > Rectangle**
* Set the offset values.

Works the same for strokes.
