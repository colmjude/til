Mum made a great peppered steak stir-fry last week, and she told me the key was **velveting**; she had marinated it with some baking powder which apparently makes cheaper cuts of meat more tender.

I then stumbled upon [an article describing **velveting**](https://www.bonappetit.com/story/velveting-meat) in asian cooking.

The technique is different, it explains creating a **slurry** with cornflour.

### Recipe

    1 Tbsp. cornstarch
    1 Tbsp. soy sauce
    1 Tbsp. vegetable or light sesame oil
    1 Tbsp. Shaoxing wine or rice vinegar

    Coat meat (and/or veg) at least 30 mins before cooking.
    Cook.
