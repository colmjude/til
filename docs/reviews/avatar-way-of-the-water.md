What a terrible film Avatar’s Way of the Water is.

I went into it wanting to like it. I enjoyed the first. It was novel, and it pushed the boundaries special effects-wise. It wasn’t the best film you could ever watch but it was a lot of what you want in a film.

This version was anything but.

It was nearly three hours long, yet it felt rushed. It felt like the story was jumping from set piece to set piece without spending more than a second developing the storyline or any characters.

There was no character you could pitch yourself behind because you know next to nothing about anyone. Even the character’s quirks that are supposed to bring the audience in jarred because we hadn’t had a chance to get to know what they were all about.

It felt like someone was following a checklist of what makes a blockbuster, which they ran through whilst Moana was on in the background.

A storyline barely existed, and the dialogue was stunted and, quite frankly, odd. The whole film was a poor repeat of the first minus everything that made the first a hit.

Nothing summed it up more than the strange self-introspective narrative. Taken from the first and a hit in the first. But that made sense. In the first they were recording a mission log. This time around, there was no mission to log. It just did not work. Jake Sulley struggled with insight when it was his job to record mission logs - but that made sense - he was a jarhead supposed to provide a depth of thought - so it gave you insight into his character as he opened his mind and shared thoughts on his new experiences….

What purpose did it serve this time? It was weird and didn’t match the reality of the once-special ops mind struggling with a softer, more inclusive mind needed to raise his family.

A mistake.

3/10
