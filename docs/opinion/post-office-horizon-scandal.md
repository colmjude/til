This scandal has been doing the rounds in the UK. It should be embarrassing that something like this can happen.

### What is it?

For years, the Post Office has been pursuing its own postmastersâ€”people running post officesâ€”for stealing. However, it turns out they haven't been stealing. The problem is with the software, Horizon, created and operated by Fujitsu.

Senior people knew about or should've known about it but they still pursued postmasters. People went to jail, lives were ruined and some people killed themselves.

But still the Post Office and Fujitsu tried to downplay and cover it up. Obfuscate, obfuscate, obfuscate and under no circumstances let on it could be a problem with the software.

### Why now?

A TV show called [Mr Bates vs The Post Office](https://www.itv.com/watch/mr-bates-vs-the-post-office/10a0469/10a0469a0001) aired on ITV, bringing it to the nation's attention.
It garnered so much attention politicians had to do something. They'd known about the injustice for years but had done little about it. Now, they had to act.

I'm not sure any politician who has spoken out about it now deserves much credit. It's indefensible; something should have been done before now.

### My thoughts

Iâ€™m fascinated (or baffled) by how this could happen, how it could be allowed to happen, how it could be allowed to continue, and how no one has really been held to account.

It demonstrates the fallibility of softwareâ€”it's only as good as the organisation and organisational culture that make it.
I don't know who needs to hear this, but software is flawedâ€”it always has been and always will be. Humans create it, with all their flaws, constraints, and biases. Of course it is going to be flawed. The better software has engineers and organisations that acknowledge this and work to fix the glaring issues.

The human tendency to defer to computers and to believe, question-free, in the answers they provide is frightening! Don't we have an obligation to check that the information is right before we act on it?
And doesn't that obligation grow the more severe the response needs to be?

Take this Post Office example. Suppose you suddenly have 100s of employees stealing from you, employees who have never previously stolen from you. In that case, you might think that was a bit odd, and the responsible thing to do would be to look into it. Or would you blindly believe in what the software is saying, come down hard on your implicated employees, and purposely shut down any avenue to explore whether the software got it wrong?

What is the right thing to do? What is the diligent thing to do? What is the moral thing to do? ðŸ˜¡

What sort of culture and incentives must be in place at the Post Office to encourage people to so wholely favour the destruction of people's lives over even contemplating that a multi-billion pound piece of software could be wrong?
