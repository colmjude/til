_This note covers last week of July and first week of August 2024_

The team is growing.

### Life of a part-time maker

When you’re not making full-time, you end up in a strange place - every time you try to do something, your environment is out of date. And fixing it takes forever.

Case in point: our [digital-land-frontend package](https://github.com/digital-land/digital-land-frontend). It was set up ages ago and still uses node-sass, but it turns out node-sass was deprecated a long time ago. However, it still remains in all our applications and prototypes.

Then, overnight, my Mac updated. In the morning, I just wanted to make a quick change to [design.planning](https://design.planning.data.gov.uk/).

Nope. node-sass was broken.

So instead of making my quick fix, I had to spend my limited time updating our frontend library to use dart-sass. Not where I wanted to be.

But the life of a part-time maker.

### Single Source of Failure

This was the week of [the CrowdStrike disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_CrowdStrike-related_IT_outages). One bug took out far too many systems worldwide, highlighting the fragility of everyone relying on the same services. Monopolies aren’t good for security.

It could’ve been worse. Most things were back up fairly quickly, but this should be a wake-up call. Luckily, no bad actor was involved this time.

But imagine if they were. More could have gone down, for longer. And now that the world knows these big security platforms have serious flaws? That’s an open invitation.

The whole thing makes it painfully clear: there’s too much concentration in the tech industry. One bug in one company’s software shouldn’t cause global chaos.

### Ethiopian Birr devaluation

[Ethiopia devalued its currency](https://www.pwc.com/ke/en/blog/ethiopian-birr-devaluation.html). It lost pretty much 30% of its value to the dollar and pound overnight (Oct update: and has steadily lost more until now its about 50% of what it was pre devaluation). That is crazy.

Apparently it was a "strategic" move - it secured a financial package from the IMF and World Bank, and is designed to encourage foreign investment into the country. However, the consequences are stark, people's buying power has essentially halved unless they are buying local, and even then inflation is high. I hope it works for them because the country could do with a bit of positivity but it is a bold move.
