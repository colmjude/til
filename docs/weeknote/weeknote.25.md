Show and tell time â€“ my turn again ðŸ˜œ

### Local plans

Gave an update on our local plans work.

The aim is to baseline local plan data by seeding and checking it. What could possibly go wrong?

The update landed well. So well, I was asked to share it more widely. That meant rerecording and posting it on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMm3ykuNXf8).

*Side note*: recording meetings in Google meet is more stressful than it should be. Once you hit stop, thereâ€™s an anxious wait for the recording to appear _somewhere_ in Drive. You just have to hope it worked... Not one of their slickest functions.

### Planning applications

Data Design has been pulled into creating data specifications for planning application submissions.

At first glance, it looks massive. And it's definitely a shift from our usual remit.

Weâ€™ve mostly focused on open data and small, discrete items. Need to know about conservation areas? Weâ€™ve got it. Tree preservation orders? On it.

But planning applications? Thatâ€™s this part, _and_ this part, _and_ this part. Right. Thatâ€™s a lot.
