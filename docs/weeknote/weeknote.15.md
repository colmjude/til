*This ‚Äúweeknote‚Äù covers November 2023.*

A few notes from the last few weeks:

* We drafted [a data model for planning conditions](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNRvkj-0=/).
* We have been fleshing out a more exhaustive data discovery process.
* I‚Äôm not a fan of the name ‚Äúdata discovery,‚Äù but it has stuck for now.
* I want to make the critical point that we need to do different things for different planning considerations. How we handle a potential dataset we‚Äôd expect to come from 1 source is different to how we handle a dataset we‚Äôd expect to come from multiple sources.
* We published an [Infrastructure funding statement specification](https://digital-land.github.io/specification/specification/infrastructure-funding-statement/).
* We gave up trying to buy a car in Addis. The car market is crazy. A 2004 RAV4 with 130,000+ miles on the clock for ¬£17,500 - no thanks.
* So we are importing one üò±
* I said and landed my first Amharic word. *Ameseginalew*. Or, thank you.

And, a few things I‚Äôve learnt:

* Google translate does not have audio for the Amharic language. This is a problem.
* Yellow fever vaccine is not recommended for people over 60. There is a greater risk of severe illness by about a factor of 4 üò±
* You can get a medical waiver. The waiver is added to a page in the yellow fever booklet, which helps when you need to flash it in an airport.
* When a bill receives Royal ascent, it is no longer a bill. It is an Act. For example, the Levelling-Up and Regeneration Bill (aka the LURB!) is now the [Levelling-Up and Regeneration Act](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/55/enacted) (aka the LURA).
