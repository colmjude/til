_This note covers 20 April 2024 - 05 May 2024_

**Big work trip to London—hectic as ever.**

The big talking point this week: a potential team rename. Moving from **Data Standards** to **Data Design**. A data standard is just one possible output from our work, whereas data design better reflects what the breadth of what the team actually does.

### Policy vs digital**

Policy can often, intentional, be open to interpretation, where as digital expects clear rules and logic. There is a tension there that we are trying to bridge. Its a constant challenge and this week was no exception.

### Design codes

We’ve been working hard to seed some **Design Code data** into our [explorer](https://design-code-prototype.planning-data.dev/design-codes). The lack of consistency in how design codes are produced and published made this tricky, but we worked through a dozen.

Sharing this data makes sense—it enables services like a **design code library**, making it easier to find and use design codes. If you're an author, you want people to actually find and use your design codes, right?

I [posted](https://github.com/digital-land/data-standards-backlog/discussions/27#discussioncomment-9315092) some details about changes we made to the [design code specification](https://digital-land.github.io/specification/specification/design-code/).

Got to say, it still baffles me that a *Design Code* contains multiple **design codes**. Naming things is hard. But it matters.

### Geospatial tools

If you need to view or explore geospatial data, [Placemark.io](https://play.placemark.io/) is well worth a try.

It’s simple, easy to use, and—best of all—means you don’t have to hope you can figure out how to get QGIS to work (always a bonus).

Perfect for quickly importing shapefiles, tweaking a few properties, and exporting as GeoJSON.

Bish bash bosh—data done.

### New beginnings

Ending the week on a sad note — [Paul Smith](https://paulsmith.site/) has left the team. He’s off to work at NHS Digital. I hope they realise they got themselves a gem. Paul you will be missed!
