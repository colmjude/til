_Weeknotes cover the week of 9th Dec 2024_

We collected over 100 CIL schedules and prepped them for the platform. Schedules first, rates second is the plan.

### Data design process

Also started reflecting on the last quarter—not just what we’ve done, but how we’ve done it. The data design process is still emerging. Each planning consideration we take through the process improves our understanding of what it takes to get from concept to data specification.

Where _successfully_ means two things:

1. Data providers can actually supply the required data.
2. The resulting data meets the needs of various consumers.

It sounds simple. It isn’t. But we’re getting better at it.

### Other stuff

Pat McFadden made a speech about reforming the public sector. A common aspiration. The test-and-learn approach is close to my heart, so I’ll be watching how this plays out.

Richard shared a thoughtful post about [the inherent precariousness of short-term contracts or “tours of duty.”](https://richardpope.org/blog/2024/03/28/precarious/) Worth a read.
