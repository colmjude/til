_Second half of March 2025_

Iâ€™ve been holed up this week, deep in the **planning application data specifications** work.

We committed to sharing draft specs by the end of March, and I didnâ€™t want us to let that slip and lose momentumâ€”even though itâ€™s been a massive piece of work.

But we got there ðŸ˜…

### Compiled specifications

We published draft compiled specifications for [21 application type and sub-type combinations](https://github.com/digital-land/planning-application-data-specification?tab=readme-ov-file#application-types).

Weâ€™re calling them _compiled_ specs because, technically, thereâ€™s a spec for each of **84 components** (83 components and 1 application model). But thatâ€™s either way too granular to look at individually, or totally overwhelming if viewed all together.

So instead, the 21 compiled specs are grouped by whatâ€™s needed for each application type (and sub-type, where relevant). Hopefully, that's much more manageable.

### A bit of tooling support

To make life easier, I built a small **command-line interface** to help with some of the repetitive tasks.

It includes a few checksâ€”for example, if you create a codelist but forget to assign it as _required_ in a module, itâ€™ll catch that.

The code isn't pretty, but it saved my bacon.

And it should keep saving time: now, if any individual module changes, I can regenerate **all the compiled specs with a single command**. Itâ€™s just for generationâ€”but still a big time-saver.


### Advisory group + community session

The advisory group session ran smoothlyâ€”and we repeated it on Friday for the wider community.

The **human-readable specs** (as opposed to machine-consumable ones) went down well. We got some good feedback straight away, especially about the `fee` field.

Right now, weâ€™ve marked `fee` as a MUST. But it was pointed out that that might be too limiting.

The point that landed with me was: it could restrict who can build systems to submit planning applicationsâ€”unless we also provide structured data on how to calculate fees and exemptions (something we are not planning yet anyway).

They gave the example of a housebuilder preparing lots of applications, who might want to submit them directly. Why not? But letting them specify the fee might be a bit like marking your own homework.

So... maybe not a MUST after all (see [issue #228](https://github.com/digital-land/planning-application-data-specification/issues/228)).

Slides and videos from the sessions are available on the [advisory group page](https://design.planning.data.gov.uk/advisory-group).

### Our approach to resolving issues

There were more [issues](https://github.com/digital-land/planning-application-data-specification/issues) than we could possibly resolve in the allotted time. And there are also issues that stray from our original goals:

* create a set of baseline specifications for submitting planning applications
* mirror the existing forms
* don't not break the current process

To handle this we had to handle as many as we could whilst being ruthless with what needs to be handled in a future iteration

### Next week

Next week, Iâ€™ll need to rejoin the wider world of **data design** and the **digital planning programme**.

Hopefully not _too_ much to catch up on ðŸ˜¬

### Non-work â€“ life

There wasn't much time for non-work life this week.
