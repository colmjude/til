I'm sorry I haven't updated my weeknotes in a while. It's been a busy few weeks at work and home.

A lot has happened in that time. Including:

* Matt and Gwen started on the Data standards team. So, we now have an entire multi-disciplinary team ðŸ’ª
* We went straight into it with a team kick-off in London (see [team weeknotes](https://digital-land.github.io/data-standards/weeknote/))
* I was ill - nothing serious, just a bad case of man-flu.
* I went to Altea, Spain, for a long weekend. Lovely place.
* It was Easter.
* We developed a [draft specification for development plan timetables](https://digital-land.github.io/specification/specification/development-plan/), which should help users create valuable data during any plan-making process.
* I've been trying to get people to understand that a data standard doesn't answer all your questions; it gives you the raw ingredients you need to answer them.
* I've been to 1000 meetings. Some of them multiple times ðŸ˜¢
* I used Mermaid to generate [some relational diagrams](https://github.com/digital-land/specification/tree/main/mermaid). Psd then trumped it with his [bespoke tool](https://digital-land.github.io/specification/specification/diagrams.html).
* I wrote more JS than I have for a while. That was tough. And it is probably pretty rubbish.
* I used ChatGPT for a helpful thing.
* We ran a data creation workshop to test the development plan standard.
* I ate the [best meal I've ever had](https://instagram.com/p/Crntaq3oc6h/) ðŸ˜‹
