*This “weeknote” covers the end of January and February 2024.*

Argh!
I was ill again 🤢

Then my parents came out to see us 🛬

We went to Kenya ❤️

And I was ill again. For the 5th time in 6 months 😭.
Things are not going so well 😰

## What I’m reading / thinking about

**Klopp**

I spend a lot of time thinking about Klopp these days: how good it has been, how much I will miss Klopp’s Liverpool, and I wonder if we’ll ever be the same without him. Etc, etc.
All very rational things for a nearly 40-year-old man to be thinking about 🤣

In my defence, I had little else to do whilst recovering from my bouts of illness.

I do have a lot of time for Klopp. Obviously, what he has done for Liverpool is huge. But I also have a lot of time for his leadership skills. I reckon we could all learn a fair bit from him. Maybe he should write a book during his time off - I’d read it, Jurgen!

Coming off the back of the final Liverpool - Man City showdown in the Jurgen vs Pep era, there has been loads of chat about Pep looking forward to seeing the back of him. I disagree. Categorically.

Facing a Klopp team has made it challenging and pushed Pep to a higher level. If each league win had been the procession that Man City’s spending warrants, then Pep wouldn’t have needed to put on his thinking cap and create what is, without doubt, a fantastic football team. Jurgen pushed him to that, and Pep knows that.
