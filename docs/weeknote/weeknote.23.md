_This weeknote covers the first 2 weeks of July 2024._

We’ve been taking **“National datasets”** through the data design process.

This means reviewing planning considerations in the [backlog](https://design.planning.data.gov.uk/planning-consideration/) where a dataset **already exists**—often, but not always, covering the whole country.

Our goal is to bring data onto the platform **where there’s a strong enough need**. To determine this, we check whether:

- There’s legislation underpinning the consideration
- We can identify a clear planning need
- Users of [planning.data.gov.uk](http://planning.data.gov.uk/) could make meaningful use of the data

It’s been a valuable exercise—giving us more data points to refine our process, improve **design.planning**, and smooth collaboration between our team, the data management team, and the platform team.

This wasn’t possible to the same degree when working on planning considerations that take much longer before usable data is even available for the data management team to collect for the platform.

### What is digital?

Digital is using internet era technology to deliver products and services that work in internet era culture.

### What happened with Kenya’s currency rally?

Back in February, the **Kenyan shilling rallied hard**—gaining nearly 10% against the pound in a day and 20% over a short period.

It happened so fast that services like TransferWise (now Wise) struggled to keep up, pausing exchanges or significantly delaying transfers.

From what I gathered, Kenya’s **fantastic currency run** was driven by market confidence in proposed measures to reduce debt.

But after last week’s worrying [social unrest](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/18/first-edition-kenya-public-protests-finance-bill), those proposals have been pulled (for now?).

So what happens next? Will the currency take a hit, or will the government's commitment to tackling debt be enough to keep it steady?

We shall see.


### AI to the rescue?

Most AI news stories come with a note of caution. But it can, should, and hopefully will, be put to good use.

One area that needs a breakthrough is “Battery tech”. If we want to make the most of renewable energy, we need better, more efficient storage. But that has proved quite elusive.

Could AI be what finally helps us make the giant strides needed?

Wouldn’t that be nice.

### Other

Only in the Premier league could losing 105 million over 3 years be considered sustainable.

Google emissions are getting out of control 😬

[GPS is under attack](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/07/02/world/gps-threats.html?te=1&nl=morning-briefing:-europe-edition&emc=edit_mbe_20240703) - The Russian version is also aging but it sounds like China is on the ball. Not only an interesting article but a nicely designed one too.
