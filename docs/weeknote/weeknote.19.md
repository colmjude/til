*This ‚Äúweeknote‚Äù is for the week beginning 18th March 2024.*

I published some stuff ü•≥

I saw [a post on LinkedIn from Mat Johnson](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/demotive_weeknotes-for-week-ending-15-march-2024-activity-7174721260453515265-H3Y-?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop). He thanked [Giles](https://doingweeknotes.com/) for [a post on BlueSky that nudged him into publishing his weeknotes](https://bsky.app/profile/gilestur.bsky.social/post/3knfx6zjf2l2f). The post led me to Giles‚Äô latest work on weeknotes, [doingweeknotes](https://gilest.org/). It really is a great resource and well worth bookmarking!

Over the last few months, I‚Äôve half-written a few things but haven‚Äôt hit the publish button. This is partly because of time, partly because I did think they were good enough, and partly because I feel my website is a bit of a mess.

But reading [‚ÄúThey‚Äôre just notes‚Äù](https://doingweeknotes.com/#itsnotanessay) reminded me not to be so precious. It was just the prompt I needed. Thank you Giles üôè

So, I published these notes:

* [Working with PRs](/notes/development/working-with-prs)
* [Useful Git commands](/notes/development/useful-git-commands)
* [Weeknote #14](/notes/weeknote/weeknote-14)
* [Weeknote #15](/notes/weeknote/weeknote-15)
* [Weeknote #16](/notes/weeknote/weeknote-16)
* [Weeknote #17](/notes/weeknote/weeknote-17)
* [Weeknote #18](/notes/weeknote/weeknote-18)
* [Post Office Horizon scandal](/notes/opinion/post-office-horizon-scandal)

I added a small script to output a list of the notes I‚Äôve created or edited in the last week. This should make it easier to share anything I‚Äôve published each week. Let's see how it goes!

On the work front, I have been embracing my maker side and pressing ahead with a tool to help us manage the planning considerations we are working through. I hope to have something concrete to share next week.

Have a good weekend everybody ‚ù§Ô∏è
