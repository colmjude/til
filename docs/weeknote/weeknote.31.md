*Covers January 13th - 31st*

Main event this week: the Advisory Group session.

Details, slides, and minutes are on the [Advisory Group page](https://design.planning.data.gov.uk/advisory-group). It went well—plenty of discussion, some high-level, some niche. There was also agreement that the group should work through the codelists needed to support planning application submissions.

My only gripe? I was presenting _and_ sharing slides, so I couldn’t take as many notes as I’d have liked.

### Planning application data specification repository

The planning application data specification work has outgrown a single discussion thread. We've now set up [a dedicated repository](https://github.com/digital-land/planning-application-data-specification) to collect all the outputs—codelists, data, information models and anything else from the work.

The new repo also means we can move away from sprawling conversations and start opening [specific issues](https://github.com/digital-land/planning-application-data-specification/issues) for things that need resolving. [Discussions](https://github.com/digital-land/planning-application-data-specification/discussions) can now focus on particular topics or modules, making it easier to track progress and decisions.
