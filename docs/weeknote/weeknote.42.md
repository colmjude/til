*Covering 12th - 23rd May*

The last two weeks have been full on. Some great moments, like spending time with the team in London. And some frustrating ones, like going round in circles in conversations instead of focusing on the actual work.

Here’s a summary of what I’ve been up to:

- the deadline for feedback on the planning application specifications passed.
    - People love a deadline. We had a flurry of feedback come in on Friday evening, and even a few bits over the weekend. All of it is very welcome.
    - We’ve [logged all the feedback](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10QprqRCo8Ss_Hpx-XkXpVHmVGewiTzWbVITEz9vXvhw/edit?usp=sharing) by issue and will now start working through it.
- we drafted a rough timeline for the planning application specification work. It's still mostly focused on submissions for now
- that sits alongside the wider team roadmap, which covers all the current workstreams across the programme
- Drew, Elliot and I began shaping what the planning application and decisions specification should include. There’s clearly demand for it, so the plan is to start small and build it up over time.
- we had a really insightful session with a planning officer. They shared the details of how they handle applications and talked us through a wide range of pain points they encounter.
- I joined a meeting with several local planning authorities to talk about decision notices. We looked at what’s legally required, how different authorities approach them, and what they’re aiming to achieve.
- I had a detailed session with Camden about the policy map and local plan they’re developing. They’ve been designing the structure of the data, including attribute tables (codelists). Some of their questions I could answer, others I’ve taken away to follow up.
- we talked about how we could rework the advisory group to improve alignment, transparency, and oversight across all the planning application data work.
- I spoke to the Providers team about the challenge of deciding which fields should be marked as required. Every field has been added to meet a specific need, so saying some are required over others would favour one use case at the expense of another. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but it’s not the usual Data Design approach.
- we had a few conversations with users and teams who want to start implementing the new specs in their systems. It’s a great sign, but it also shows the need to move towards a more declarative model. I’ve started writing up what that means and what people should expect.
- etc.

So yes, a lot. Now hoping we can carve out some time to actually move things forward. Plenty to follow up on, plenty to write up, and plenty to get done.
