_This weeknote covers 9 June - 20 June_

A lot of progress this fortnight, mostly continuing the detailed work on the planning application submission specifications, and what follows.

### Submission specification(s): still going strong

I spent most of the week working through issues in the planning application submission specifications. Some of it was technical cleanup, some of it more strategic.

One small but satisfying moment: we finally removed the `fax-number` field from the contact details module. I'm pleased about that.

### Tracking changes

I‚Äôve set up [a changelog for the planning application work](https://github.com/digital-land/planning-application-data-specification/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md). It‚Äôs not essential for this phase but it will be.

Once specifications are mandated, we‚Äôll need a clear, reliable change history. Doing it now lets us test what‚Äôs actually useful to people. What belongs in a changelog? What doesn‚Äôt? Etc.

It also helps demonstrate the scale of the work. When everything‚Äôs in flight, a running changelog is a good way to show what‚Äôs already been done.

I used [git-chglog](https://github.com/git-chglog/git-chglog), which was refreshingly easy to get going. [Steps are documented in a note](/notes/development/an-automated-changelog).

### A declaractive householder specification

I completed the declarative version of the householder application spec, including:
	‚Ä¢	the full application definition
	‚Ä¢	all applicable modules
	‚Ä¢	reusable components
	‚Ä¢	all individual fields

Having a full, worked example really helped validate the approach.

Some parts are feeling solid. For example, defining a field that points to a reusable component:

```yaml
datatype: object  
component: contact-details
```

That pattern‚Äôs proving clean and easy to follow.

Other bits still need thinking, especially conditions like this:

```
fields:
  - field: an-example-field
    applies-if:
      - application-type:
        - in: ["full", "outline"]
```

Working with real cases makes a big difference.

I‚Äôve also started adding [module-level data examples](https://github.com/digital-land/planning-application-data-specification/tree/main/specification/example). The idea is to eventually compile these into complete payloads with a bit of tooling.


### Tooling

Now that we‚Äôre moving toward a more declarative approach, we can start validating the specifications in new ways.

So I‚Äôve added some lightweight tooling to check basic integrity across applications, modules, components, and fields. It‚Äôs not fancy, but it‚Äôs enough to catch bad references and structure errors before they become problems.

On a related note, I‚Äôve added [a list of modules with active issues](https://github.com/digital-land/planning-application-data-specification/blob/main/issue-tracking/index.md). This should save us from repeatedly asking ‚Äúwhich ones still need work?‚Äù It‚Äôs a live tracker: as issues are resolved, modules drop off the list.

### Applications and decisions

We‚Äôre revisiting the planning applications and decisions space. Drew, Elliot, and I had an earlier whiteboard session, and I‚Äôve now drafted a deliberately limited data model for decisions. I‚Äôve shared [a write-up in the GitHub discussion](https://github.com/digital-land/data-standards-backlog/discussions/25#discussioncomment-13530686).

Unfortunately, due to changes in our Mural accounts, I can‚Äôt currently share the original board. Working on it.

In the meantime, we‚Äôre kicking off a research piece focused on decisions. With submissions, we worked from an existing set of requirements (the application forms). Those defined the shape of the work.

With decisions, we‚Äôre flipping it:
	‚Ä¢	start small
	‚Ä¢	only include what we‚Äôre confident about
	‚Ä¢	use the community and user research to surface what‚Äôs really needed

It‚Äôs a different approach, but a necessary one. Lots of people want access to this data so it's important we figure out what will actually be useful.

### Other updates

	‚Ä¢	more [planning condition data is now on the platform](https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/dataset/planning-condition), thanks to another batch from Doncaster
	‚Ä¢	I tweaked the [listed building dataset specification](https://digital-land.github.io/specification/specification/listed-building/) after we reviewed HMLR‚Äôs local land charge data. We‚Äôve added `uprns` to capture all properties affected, and reintroduced a `description` field. I this case, essential for explaining whether the dataset refers to curtilage, property boundary, or something else.

## In other news 

The Prime Minister announced Extract, a new AI tool to help councils digitise old planning documents:
üëâ [i.AI plans rollout of Extract AI tool for councils ‚Äì UKAuthority](https://www.ukauthority.com/articles/iai-plans-roll-out-of-extract-ai-tool-for-councils)

Extract should make it much easier for local authorities to generate data that fits our specifications. That means more data, faster, and that‚Äôs key to improving services and speeding up planning decisions.

The team behind Extract said our specifications made their lives easier. They didn‚Äôt have to invent structure, they could just plug into what was already there.

That was encouraging to hear. Because that‚Äôs the whole point.
We‚Äôre doing the work to define usable, consistent specifications so others don‚Äôt have to.
Then, they can focus on their part of the puzzle; digitising, interpreting, integrating and building services knowing the structure‚Äôs already in place.

And that‚Äôs how we start to unlock better data, build better services and make better decisions.
