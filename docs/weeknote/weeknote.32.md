_Covers week beginning 3rd Feb 2025_

It was another busy week in the land of data design.

### Local plans

Back in late November, we ran a "SWARM" day to check the local plan data we’d collected.

Since then, we’ve been trying to organise a follow-up session. There’s still a lot to get through—200+ plans—but it’s been hard to get people to commit their time. Fair to say momentum has been lost.

People want the data, but there’s a lot going on. The daily news cycle about planning reforms says it all—creating the data from scratch is not top of the list.

We’re exploring other approaches. I even reviewed five plans the other day while sat in a meeting I probably didn’t need to be in.

In the meantime, I wrote up [what we learned from the first session](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QERjoyZ-7oZkhNdxRmUXDVhCfxZj105SGmEaWUX9uYI/edit?usp=sharing). Needed to capture it before it completely left my head. It also includes lessons for future sessions.

### Data on the platform

More data on the platform ✅  
This time: [air quality management areas](https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/map/?dataset=air-quality-management-area).

### Planning applications

Work continues on the planning application data specification. Liz and Mike have been planning the next Advisory Group session (26th Feb), while I’ve been chipping away—synthesising contributions and prepping for the first draft of the specs.

[The list of issues](https://github.com/digital-land/planning-application-data-specification/issues) is growing, but that’s to be expected at this stage.

After checking the details with Elliot, we've also added **Hedgerow removal notices** to the list of [planning application types](https://github.com/digital-land/planning-application-data-specification/blob/main/data/planning-application-type.csv).

In related news, we’ve been working with Camden and Doncaster on a [specification for planning conditions](https://digital-land.github.io/specification/specification/planning-condition/).

### Outside work

Hard to look past what the Trump administration is doing to USAID. It’s a political choice, sure. But does it need to be done so brutally? An untold number of lives will be affected. It’s sad to see.
