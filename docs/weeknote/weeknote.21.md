*This weeknote covers April 8th to April 21st.*

## Holiday

I spent most of the last 2 weeks on holiday 😎

We went to see my sister in Spain but couldn’t get a direct flight from Addis Ababa, so we went via Rome. Oh well 🍕🍝🍷🍦

Note to anyone going to Rome any time soon:

Getting the train from Rome Fiumicino (FCO) airport into the city is easy. It’s worth taking if you don’t fancy dealing with taxi drivers and is cheap at around €8 per person.

While we are on taxis in Rome, beware (some) taxi drivers. They will try to rip you off. Agree on the price or make sure it is on the meter before you get in. And, get the hotel to order you a taxi so that a bit of the responsibility is on them.

If you are an Uber user, it is available in Rome but less abundantly available in other places.

Rome airport has security scanners where you can leave everything in your bags. It improves the whole experience. Especially when you have a buggy, a reluctant toddler and all the bags. I can’t wait for it to be rolled out worldwide 🙏

Spending time in Spain really got us thinking. Everything works, the weather is great and the food excellent. And, we discovered [Spain and Italy have much higher life expectancy than the UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy). Why? Is it the Mediterranean diet, all that sun, or something else? Whatever it is, I like it. We should move there 🤔

### Back to work

Work continues on the considerations app. We have been adding in the questions we need to answer at each stage of [our design process](https://digital-land.github.io/blog-post/our-data-standards-design-process/).

Initially, we hoped we could start using the app once we’d added a few of the questions. However, we’ve made the call that adding some of the more complicated questions and flows will force us to change the data model. We don’t want to do that after the team has added a lot of content. If we did, we’d get stuck in data migration activities instead of being able to make changes quickly.

I’m hoping we can make the switch next week 🤞
