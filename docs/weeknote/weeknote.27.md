*Covers week 25th - 29th Nov 2024*

This week, I was in London putting in a shift.

### Local plans

Monday kicked off with a workshop to verify the local plan data we’ve been collecting. A semi success—we got [some data onto the platform](https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/dataset/local-plan) but didn’t get through everything. [Prototype here](https://local-plans-explorer-0d7b65a24242.herokuapp.com/).

Still, I’ll call it a win. It highlighted the challenge of reverse-engineering documents to extract data. And how data demands a level of precision that policy doesn't always have, sometimes by design. Case in point are the names authorities use for the various stages of the local plan-making process.

### Planning applications

Wednesday was the first [advisory group](https://design.planning.data.gov.uk/advisory-group) session for the planning application data specs. Another success.

### Team time

Thursday: long-overdue team day at the Arup offices.  
Friday: back at HQ, talking data design, [planning.data.gov.uk](https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/), and sketching out plans for the new year.

### Other stuff

Finally received my copy of [_Platformland_](https://amzn.to/4geTvo6) by Richard Pope. Really looking forward to this one.
