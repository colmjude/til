*This ‚Äúweeknote‚Äù covers the first couple of weeks of March 2024.*

## Work

I was back in London for one of the weeks. It was nice to walk around freely ‚Äî I miss that living in Addis. Overall, the week was a success, but it was hectic, and I was left exhausted!

We made good use of the office time. We packed it in and got plenty of face time; plenty of workshopping happened. And it is always good to reconnect with colleagues. But, like I said, come Friday I was running on empty.

If I was being critical, there were a few things we could‚Äôve done just as well remotely. But still ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Hybrid work still poses a real challenge that we/someone needs to solve. I‚Äôm still all for it, and we are getting better at it, but we‚Äôve not mastered it yet! An organisation that solves it will be onto a winner.

On to what I actually did recently:

* Matt and I spent the day with the digital planning team at Camden. We are exploring the opportunity to work with a regional planning authority on an exemplar, and Camden is a great candidate.
* I wrote [a script to automatically generate the stage count diagram](https://github.com/digital-land/data-standards/blob/main/_bin/stages-svg.py). I prepared a template SVG in Illustrator, added ids and classes to the markup and wrote a python script to generate a new version daily.
* We revisited the [design code specification](https://app.mural.co/t/mhclg2837/m/mhclg2837/1709140526813/9a28b5a76405c33dbb1568a2870a5e6057bf0b91?sender=u0a3f3dbf2e64a1ee0ea83028). Along with partners from the [Office for Place](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-for-place), we plan to seed some data. This will allow us to test the data model and enable the Office for Place to build a design code library prototype based on real data.
* I spent a lot of time breaking down the questions we answer during [our design process stages](https://digital-land.github.io/blog-post/our-data-standards-design-process/) and started mapping out what an app to manage our work might look like. At the moment, we use a Google Doc to capture information about each planning consideration. It is pretty unwieldy.
* We published[ guidance on publishing your development plan data](https://digital-land.github.io/guidance/publish-your-development-plan-data/). It now needs testing.

## Other stuff

It's 5 weeks and counting since I last went to the gym üò¨ I have the illnesses as an excuse, but that record needs to change.

This [no-knead bread recipe from the New York Times](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/11376-no-knead-bread) is a winner. I‚Äôd highly recommend it (note, it does require a cast iron pot).

I think I‚Äôve finally solved our TV streaming woes. It required an Apple TV and a VPN, but so far, so good.

## What I‚Äôm reading / thinking about

[A good read as ever from Richard Pope](https://richardpope.org/talks/2024/03/12/appg-rule-of-law-user-centred-design/). This time on user-centred design in government not being enough.

What can you say about [what Frank Hester said](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/mar/11/biggest-tory-donor-looking-diane-abbott-hate-all-black-women)? The words are clearly racist and anyone struggling to admit that needs to have a word with themselves.

On the whole subject, I found Samuel Kasumu's intervention quite powerful and welcome. In particular, I appreciated his call for Hester to do more than just apologise. Apologies aren‚Äôt enough.

The more power you have (whether from money, position or privilege), the more you should do to counter society's imbalances. If you have a platform, use it kindly. What you do and say matters.

With great power comes great responsibility!

Just a couple of months ago, I was listening to a popular podcast (I won‚Äôt say which - it is not my intention to castigate them), which is one almighty platform. They said something clumsy, something they shouldn‚Äôt really be saying or, at the very least, something they don‚Äôt need to say. There are alternative phrases. So I emailed them, asking them to think about the power they have and the phrases they use. No reply yet but, I do hope they listen.
