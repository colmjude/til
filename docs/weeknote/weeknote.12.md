It has been a while. Again. My bad.

Lets try to recap whats happened in the last few months! I’ll try to keep it brief because it needs to cover a huge period - April to August!

Things worth noting include:

- we’ve had a busy old time at work with lots of upheaval
- but we’ve made small bits of progress
- we drafted a [planning-application specification](https://digital-land.github.io/specification/specification/planning-application/)
- and built [a prototype](https://planning-application-prototype-876601a5bfae.herokuapp.com/) to test it using real, already available data
- we are trying to open up our data standard design process, we’ve
    - published a page outlining [what we are working on](https://digital-land.github.io/data-standards/what-we-are-working-on/)
    - published [our backlog of planning considerations](https://digital-land.github.io/data-standards/what-we-are-working-on/backlog)
    - opened up [discussions on github discussions](https://github.com/digital-land/data-standards-backlog/discussions)
- all the above is managed in a googlesheet which keeps things simple for the team to maintain
- I went on [holiday to Zante](https://www.instagram.com/p/Csbiq3bIiiP/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==). It was the first time I’ve been on an all-inclusive holiday. It was perfect for what we wanted 
- I won our FPL league with a late surge. It turns out being up there is stressful. But at least that monkey is off my bad 💪
- I’ve started the new FPL season still hungover 🤦‍♂️
- Vanessa and I went back to Seville for a weekend. I ate [the best pulpo 🐙](https://www.instagram.com/p/CxVUC7JopiF/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==)
- we had the wettest summer of all time - possibly an exaggeration but it was awful
- oh yeah, and we moved to Addis Ababa ✈️
