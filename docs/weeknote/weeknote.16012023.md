This week I had a week off from the daily grind but it still felt pretty busy. I tried to use the week as an opportunity to start 2023 in good shape.

### I‚Äôm going to write weeknotes. Promise.

I‚Äôve started to write weeknotes. Again. This time I‚Äôm going to make it easier on myself. Accept short ones are fine and I just get in the habit of writing things down and publishing.

Following [Matt‚Äôs tips on weeknotes](https://learnbymaking.wales/en/resource/tips-for-writing-weeknotes.html) I‚Äôm going to focus on writing what I did, if I learnt anything worth sharing and sharing anything I can show for the week.

I‚Äôm going to keep them in the [/notes](https://colmjude.com/notes) section on my site. In my head this is a lower level than the blog section so I feel they can be rougher sitting here.

It also gives me an incentive to keep working on my [TIL notes system](https://github.com/colmjude/til). This week I added the ability to embed tweets.

### Perfect is the enemy of done

I have to keep reminding myself things can‚Äôt always be perfect and sometimes - most times - I just need to get things out there. With this in mind I added a couple of bits to [my portfolio](/work). I still need to do write ups but at least I now reference them.

Resurrected the website for [ByBritton Ltd](https://bybritton.co.uk) from the doldrums. Its a static site so I‚Äôve moved it to GitHub Pages. How to use your own domain with [GitHub page](https://pages.github.com/).

### Favicons

Last week I added a favicon to the [learnbymaking site](https://learnbymaking.wales/en/). I work with Favicons so infrequently that when I do it always feels like a bit of a faff.

So this week I published [notes on adding a favicon to a site](https://colmjude.com/notes/web/how-to-favicon/) including an [Illustrator template for favicons](https://colmjude.com/static/resources/favicon-template.ai).

### What I‚Äôve learnt

A couple of things that have stuck with me this week include:

- How important gut health is to general health - [The Next Big Idea podcast with Tim Spector](https://nextbigideaclub.com/magazine/stop-diets-start-habits-mythbusting-insights-eating-podcast/38998/)
- how to create and [schedule](https://www.notion.so/help/guides/automate-work-repeating-database-templates) recurring [templates on Notion](https://www.notion.so/help/database-templates). We will see how this works. I‚Äôm using this approach for my weeknotes. A new one gets created on a Monday containing some prompts. I‚Äôll fill it in during the week and finish it off at the end.
- I watched a [TED talk about Slow motion multi-tasking being key to creativity (Video)](https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_harford_a_powerful_way_to_unleash_your_natural_creativity?language=en). It‚Äôs always nice to be reminded that having a wide range of interests and activities is a good thing.

I also started a course on sketchnotes. Its from [Eva-Lotta Lamm](https://www.evalotta.net/) whose work I always enjoy.

Every year I say I‚Äôm going to start sketching and drawing again. I never do. Maybe this will help me get started.

### Anything else

This week, I also had some chats about some potential jobs. I hate these, I find them so awkward ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
