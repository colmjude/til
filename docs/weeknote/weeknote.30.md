_Covers the first working week of 2025 (Jan 6th–10th)_

Back to work after two weeks away from the laptop.

We spent the break in Franschhoek and Cape Town. More on that later—spoiler: it was great.

### Back to it

Day 1 was fine.

Plenty of chats about Q4 objectives. It was useful to reflect on what worked last quarter and set priorities for this one. Top of the list: scaling and enabling others to follow the data design process. The challenge will be balancing that with everything else we need to deliver.

Day 2 was where things went sideways.

Too many people wanted to pick up pre-Christmas threads, when the real focus should’ve been prepping for the next Advisory Group session. We need to shift gears now—from gathering information to making sense of it. How we do that is the question.

The rest of the week followed the shape of Day 2. But there were a few highlights:

- Helped Adam with some JS and CSS to make the [backlog of considerations](https://design.planning.data.gov.uk/planning-consideration/) work with synonyms. The idea was to keep synonyms hidden until they became relevant—during search. A nice little distraction between meetings.
- Another Adam-related win: we came up with an idea for a generic app that could work with any of our specs. Right now, we keep spinning up prototypes that do similar things but for different datasets. A reusable approach would save us from reinventing the wheel.
- Finally caught up with Mike about the planning application data spec work. We have a plan.
