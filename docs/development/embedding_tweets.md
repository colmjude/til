I wanted to embed a tweet in a note. I thought, everyone does this so it must be easy.

Now it is easy if you want to manually go to twitter each time you want to embed a tweet and copy the embed code.

But I wanted to be able to use the URL so that it would be marginally quicker (and easier to read in the markdown).

I looked for an existing python markdown extension but couldn't find one. I'm sure there must be one somewhere but finding it was beyond me.

So, instead, I wrote my own ðŸ«£

Firstly, I used this [blog post about embedding a tweet in a flask blog](https://ezzeddinabdullah.com/post/embed-tweet-blog-flask-headless-cms/) as inspiration.

Task one was setting up a [Twitter developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/en) - to get credentials for accessing twitter. It's easy and free. You need to create a project, an app and then generate an access token to go with the API key.

I used the [tweepy](https://docs.tweepy.org/) library which has a [get_oembed](https://docs.tweepy.org/en/stable/api.html#post-retrieve-and-engage-with-tweets) function. This function takes a twitter url and returns the HTML for embedding the tweet.

I then created a markdown extension that would match a pattern like

```
{{:twitter <twitter-url>}}
```

For example
```
{{:twitter https://twitter.com/ColmBritton/status/1583455055088271360}}
```

Which should embed one of my tweets...

{{:twitter https://twitter.com/ColmBritton/status/1583455055088271360}}
