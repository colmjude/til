### To do

* style markdown content
* make titles human readable or file name (and vice versa) ?
* make static dir configurable ?
* make tags on note page links
* style a blockquote (Weeknote 27th July)
* only deploy new or changed notes


### Ideas

* deploy script
* render list pages?
* datasette search? (via a datasette instance https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1252051240583696385) | Example https://github.com/simonw/til/blob/master/python/generate-nested-json-summary.md

### Done

* script to make til file with title, frontmatter and dir
* slug from file name
* render each file as page on colmjude.com
* add tags to page
* title from frontmatter
* don't render notes in draft
* caption for under "Notes" title, maybe "a collection of my notes, TILs and snippets"
* make command to do clean and render
* style inline code elements
* get wikilinks working, and document how to use them in README
* add today date/string to frontmatter from creation script
* make week note template script

* Wikilinks need to do more than top level links
